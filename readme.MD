## üöÄ About The Project

Online clothes shopping has two major problems: the uncertainty of **fit and appearance**, and the overwhelming **paradox of choice**. Vesture AI tackles both.

This full-stack MERN & FastAPI application is an end-to-end e-commerce solution that serves both **Buyers** and **Sellers**. Its core innovation lies in its two intelligent systems:

1.  **Virtual Try-On**: Users can upload a photo of themselves to see how a piece of clothing will actually look on their body, drastically reducing the uncertainty that leads to returns.

2.  **Personalized Recommendation Engine**: Going beyond simple filters, the platform acts as a personal stylist. It analyzes a user's unique profile‚Äîincluding skintone, body type, age, and style preferences‚Äîto recommend clothes they'll love.

This project is not just a storefront; it's a complete, AI-driven fashion ecosystem.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm
* Python (v3.9 or later)
* pip
* MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB instance)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Manthan0207/VestureAI.git](https://github.com/Manthan0207/VestureAI.git)
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend (Node.js)**
    ```sh
    cd Server
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `Server` directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    # MongoDB Connection String
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

    # Server Port
    PORT=3000

    # JWT Secret for authentication tokens
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

    # Application Environment
    NODE_ENV=development

    # Frontend URL for CORS
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

    # Gmail credentials for sending verification emails
    GMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address@gmail.com
    GMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password

    # Cloudinary credentials for image storage
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    ```
    Then, start the server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Setup the AI Service (FastAPI)**
    ```sh
    cd ML-API
    ```
    It is highly recommended to create a Python virtual environment (`venv`) to avoid global dependency issues.
    ```sh
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On MacOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Now, install the required packages within your activated environment:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Create a `.env` file if needed for any AI service API keys. Start the service:
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

4.  **Setup the Frontend (React)**
    ```sh
    cd client/frontend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env.local` file in the `client/frontend` directory and add your backend server URL:
    ```env
    VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```
    Then, start the frontend development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
